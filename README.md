# Description:
This repository contains the implementation of a Diabetes Risk Prediction Model designed to estimate an individualâ€™s likelihood of developing diabetes based on key health indicators and lifestyle factors. Leveraging machine learning techniques, the model provides accurate and actionable insights to support proactive healthcare interventions.

# Features:
Data Preprocessing: Includes data cleaning, normalization, and feature engineering scripts.
Machine Learning Models: Implements and compares multiple algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) for diabetes risk prediction.
Evaluation Metrics: Provides tools to evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC-ROC.
Explainability: Integrates SHAP values or similar techniques for model interpretability.
Deployment-Ready: Contains code for deploying the model as an API or integrating it into web applications.

# Contents:
data/: Sample datasets for training and testing the model (synthetic or anonymized).
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and model development.
src/: Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
models/: Pretrained models and configurations.
deployment/: Code for deploying the model using Flask, FastAPI, or similar frameworks.
docs/: Documentation for setup, usage, and customization.

# How to Use:
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/diabetes-risk-prediction.git
Follow the setup instructions in the README.md.
Run the preprocessing and training scripts or use the pretrained model for predictions.

# Applications:
Healthcare Professionals: To assist in early detection and preventive care for at-risk patients.
Researchers: As a foundation for developing advanced models or integrating new datasets.
Individuals: For self-assessment (with proper deployment as a web or mobile application).

# Contributions:
Contributions are welcome! Feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request for improvements or new features.
